Design process:
For my website, i wanted to generate a concert website for one of my favourite artists, Tuyu. i wanted it to show the different track songs that were going to be played at the concert, what kind of band tuyu was, as well as display their  popular hits. I also wanted to create a part where the visitors could order their tickets, as well as wishlist certain new merchandise going to be sold at the concert physically. 

Page 1
shows the different songs, with a top bar which can navigate to all the other pages. Below thats is a button to book now, which immediately brings you to the 4th html where you can get your tickets, making it convenient. The raining javascript also makes the website look more aesthetic. 

page 2
As for the second page, It would be a nice effect if I put certain effects like unique interactions when hovering over certain objects. e.g. the disc hovering causing the disc to come out and spin. This makes the site feel more visually appealing. Below that is the place for people who are interested to be able to listen to their music through the music carousel, which also allows for easy access for users.

page 3
Added 8 different pieces of merchandise to showcase what would be sold at the concert. it gives information like price and name, as well as picture reference. This page is also interactive as when users hover over the itemms, they would pop out. They can also choose to wishlist the items theyu'd like thus making the website even more interactive

page 4
I remeber using golden village to book a movie for me and myb friends, and their seat layout inspired me to go and try to create one seat planning style plan which is interactive, allowing users to pick seats which are still available and book them. They would be able to pick the seats as shown on the plan, then have to fill in their name and email in order to complete booking.
